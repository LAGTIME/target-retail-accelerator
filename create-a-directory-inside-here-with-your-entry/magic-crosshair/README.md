##Description

**TL;DR** (aka __Executive Summary__): Crosshair is similar to those "Magic 8 Balls" toys: you ask a question, shake the ball, turn it over an get your answer.

###Use Case

It's your girlfriend's birthday. Ypu want to surprise her with a gift. You know that she loves glass vases but you don't know much about them, except for the one she purchased with you 6 months ago. You know that if you ask her, or her big-mouth friends, the secret will be spoiled. While in the shopping mall, as you walk past the Target, you remember that you have the Crosshair app installed on your smartphone. You fire it up, and tap "glass vases" into the search box on the welcome screen. A few moments later, the initial match crosshair comes up, centered on glass vases. You recognizes that one as the one she purchased with you. You give the phone a quick shake, and a moment later the crosshair is centered on a pretty interesting-looking vase similar to vases that you're sure your GF does not possess. You would never have picked it out it in a million years. You click on the bullseye to get the product details: it turns out that the price is right, and it's in stock! You purchase it in the store, and a day later, surprise the GF, who's amazed at your great taste. Mobile search and navigation through Target's large product catalog has just been made easy and fun.

###Quick Overview

**Crosshair is an intelligent and customizable mobile search filter for the Target catalog** that will reveal the best products and closest neighbors (similar products, along any number of spectrum, which can be pre-selected by Target, or customized by the user.)

...don't like what you found? Click on one of the neighbors mapped on the crosshair UI, and the interface reorients and recenters on your selection.

...or just shake your device to get a surprise view of products neighboring your original search.

...click on the bullseye to get detailed product information, check in-store availability, add products to your shopping cart, or save to a Target shopping list.

...built-in social features lets you save your crosshairs and share them with family, friends, coworkers, and which can be reused as the starting points for further discovery.

###Additional Details

The user can view the product details by clicking on the bullseye, where detailed information from the Target product catalog can be optained, such as pricing, review, availability, and the product can be order (placed into a shopping cart), or added to a Target list for later retrieval.

If the customer is more interested in seeing relevant products that may be more surprising or different, he can return to the crosshair, and click on one of the "neighbor" productions mapped. The UI will reorient itself and center itself on the selection, and reveal new neighbors, while keeping the original closest match in sight.

Or, if users want to have that "Magic 8 Ball" experience, give their touch-sensitive device a quick shake, and the crosshair will reorient and recenter automatically, again, keeping the closest match in sight.

This app and UI presents products, and similar items, in a novel, compact way, that also makes it fun for the users. It' uses the core visual conciet of Target's corporate identity as a feature. Moveover, we feel that the interface, which based on the class quandrant, presents some unique ways to present products across different dimensions.

The "list" feature will allow people to have crosshairs as lists which can then be shared with other family members, friends, wedding registry invitees, etc.
